# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Luka Slater and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.
I have been a self-taught software engineer for the past 4 years as I have been doing occasional freelance work for others but also creating small
projects for myself such as webpage automation, anti-cheat reverse engineering, and using AI recognition with yolo-v8. Over the years I have gotten
to code in Python, C++, C#, Javascript/NodeJS, and HTML.

### Lab 7

  * Lab 7, Part 2, has been my favorite lab so far because it gave me the unique
    opportunity to bring one of my favorite games, blackjack, to life through coding.
    Developing a blackjack game combined my passion for the card game with my love for
    problem-solving in computer science. This lab was not just a learning experience—it
    was a rewarding challenge that made coding feel like a creative and engaging endeavor.
    I have heard in the past from others that blackjack is a good coding project for
    beginners in the computer science world and after doing so I can definetly agree.
    
### Lab 11

  * Lab 11, Part 1, was one of the most challenging yet rewarding labs I’ve worked on so
    far. I enjoyed it because it pushed my coding skills to the next level, especially in
    working with CSV files. It was fascinating to see how we could use CSV files to store
    and read large amounts of data, and then write code to analyze it for things like
    population, land area, and ensity. This lab really opened my eyes to the practical
    applications of programming in organizing and interpreting data efficiently. I know
    the skills I learned here will stick with  me and prove incredibly useful in future
    projects where managing and analyzing data is essential.
    
### Lab 12

  * Lab 12, part 1 had to be my overall favorite due to it creating graphics like
    a gradient image which was a really fun and new experience. It was amazing to
    see how the image changed when I changed some of the code and it turned into
    a completely different image. This had to be the most fun and entertaining lab
    out of all the 12 labs we did throughout the semester due to the fact that had the
    opportunity to experiment with graphic design.
